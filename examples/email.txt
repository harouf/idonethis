Morning
- Fun: watched sc2 before getting up
- Fun: finished watching Mad Max
- Productive: did iontophoresis for 30 min 15mA DC hand/foot 50/50. Feet shallowly submerged.

Afternoon
- Friends: had lunch w/ Jason Steiner at Which Wich in San Carlos. He had this idea for a venture capital firm that was an insurance company for medical services that weren't covered by other insurance
- Productive: did grocery shopping. Went to REI and bought a day pack as well as a length of cord. This guy taught me some knots
- Fun: watched a bit of sc2
- Productive: caught up with things

Evening
- Friends: went over to GSB library to catch up with Vu. Practiced tying knots.
- Friends: went to a talk by Katherine Bigelow (Hurt Locker) at Cemex w/ Vu, Tom and Vu's friend. I'm glad I went up and asked her a question afterwards.
- Friends: went to Coupa at GSB and hung out w/ Vu, Tom, Vu's friend, Tia, and Salil. Actually had a deep conversation about stress and life, Tia is doing more meditation and admits to being more stressed in her 30's, I told them about my upcoming ayahuasca retreat
- Friends: invited Tom over to my place and we had scotch and talked. Talked a lot about my disillusionment with how you have to be a certain type of person to be able to raise money and in general to succeed in startups (i.e. irrational optimism, somewhat ruthless). Tom echoed the same sentiments
- Fun: watched sc2 before sleeping

Overall
Good day.
Glad I resisted having dessert. Caught up with a lot of GSB had had a really good talk with them. Had scotch with Tom and had a great talk with him. Caught up with Steiner too.
